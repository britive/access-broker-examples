# Active Directory Access

This folder contains various examples Powershell scripts.
These scripts allow for better access management in Active Directory. The goal here is to secure high privilege access by granting ephemeral access or rotating credentials of powerful user accounts.

To **run Active Directory (AD) cmdlets like `Get-ADUser` or `Add-ADGroupMember` on a Windows machine**, the following prerequisites must be met:

---

### ‚úÖ **Pre-Requisite: Active Directory PowerShell Module Must Be Installed**

To ensure this is configured for **all users**, you can **install the RSAT: Active Directory module** via PowerShell (must be run as Administrator):

#### üõ† PowerShell Command to Install AD Module (Windows 10/11 or Server 2019/2022):

```powershell
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0"
```

---

### üîç To Verify Installation (Optional):

```powershell
Get-WindowsCapability -Name RSAT.ActiveDirectory* -Online
```

---

### üß† What This Does:

* Installs the **Active Directory module** for Windows PowerShell (`ActiveDirectory`).
* Allows any user (with appropriate permissions) to run `Import-Module ActiveDirectory` and use `Get-ADUser`, `Add-ADGroupMember`, etc.
* Makes the module globally available ‚Äî no need to manually import for every user session (though `Import-Module` is still commonly used at the start of scripts for safety).

---

### üß™ Optional: Check if AD module is available before running script

Add this to the top of your script to ensure the module is installed:

```powershell
if (-not (Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name ActiveDirectory)) {
    Write-Error "The ActiveDirectory module is not installed. Run the following as admin:`nAdd-WindowsCapability -Online -Name 'Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0'"
    exit 1
}
```
