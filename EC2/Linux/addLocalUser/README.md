// It first checks if the user exists, and if so, it removes the user and their home directory.
// It also removes any sudo access by deleting the corresponding file in /etc/sudoers.d.
// The script uses the `pkill` command to terminate any processes owned by the user before deletion.
// The `|| true` part ensures that the script continues even if the command fails, which is useful for optional cleanup tasks.
// The script is designed to be run with elevated privileges, so it uses `sudo` for commands that require root access.
// The `set -e` command ensures that the script exits immediately if any command fails, which is a good practice for scripts that modify system state.
